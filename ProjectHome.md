The Tower of Eternity is a visually stunning massively multiplayer online role-playing game featuring cutting-edge imagery, breath-taking environments, and a unique world of fantasy. You play a pivotal role in the fate of Atreia, where flying takes on a completely new role and the enemy is not only the other player faction, but a deadly ancient evil as well.

## Emulator version ##
This is a backup Aion Emulator Source From Aion-Unique http://www.aion-unique.org/
In case they loose all their data as Aion-Emu did and leave people without Source after many of us help on this project

# Our Goal #
Our goal is to create reliable emulator of aion game server, providing great stability, high performance and gameplay on the same level as official servers do.

# Technologies #
We've decided to use java programming language, which gaurantes shorter development time (comparing for example to C++), with almost no loss on performance.

  * coders with good java knowledge and experience
  * people who would work on datapack
  * people with assembler, and reverse engineering generally, experience
  * and of course people who could provide us with information about features from official servers.
